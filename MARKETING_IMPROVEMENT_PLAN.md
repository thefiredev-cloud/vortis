# Vortis Marketing Improvement Plan

**Based on Octagon MCP Research & ReactBits.dev Design Patterns**

---

## Executive Summary

After comprehensive research into Octagon MCP's actual capabilities and ReactBits.dev design patterns, this plan outlines specific improvements to transform Vortis's marketing from generic AI messaging to data-driven, credible positioning that showcases real capabilities without exposing the tech stack.

**Key Insight**: Instead of "AI-powered insights," we should highlight specific, measurable capabilities like "Access financial data from 8,000+ public companies with 10 years of historical depth."

## Current State Analysis

### What's Working ✅
- Orb background creates premium feel
- Glassmorphism design is modern
- Basic structure is clean
- Animation system is in place

### What Needs Improvement ⚠️
- **Too Generic**: "AI-powered insights" could be any product
- **No Credibility**: Missing specific data points and numbers
- **Vague Features**: "SEC Filing Analysis" doesn't communicate value
- **Missing Social Proof**: No statistics or trust indicators
- **Limited Feature Showcase**: Only 3 feature cards when we have 10+ major capabilities
- **Pricing Lacks Specificity**: Features like "Deep SEC filing analysis" are unclear

## Proposed Improvements

### Phase 1: Immediate High-Impact Changes

#### 1.1 Hero Section Transformation

**CURRENT:**
```
"Advanced AI-powered platform that analyzes SEC filings, regulatory
compliance, and real-time market data to deliver institutional-grade
trading intelligence."
```

**IMPROVED:**

and 3M+ private companies. Analyze 10 years of SEC filings, earnings
transcripts, and institutional holdings—all in seconds."
```

**Why it's better:**

  <StatItem>
    <AnimatedNumber value={10000} />+
    <Label>Stock Tickers</Label>
  </StatItem>

  </StatItem>

  <StatItem>
    <AnimatedNumber value={500} />k+
    <Label>Funding Deals</Label>
